> think of react context as a pizza with different ingredient for each slice. you don,t wanna mix them, the taste won't probably be the expected one.
>
> - **split one context to small independent slices**: if one slace change, only the components using this slice will rerender

> - **no props drilling**: the containers between the parent and the children are not affected anymore by receiving props just to pass them down.
